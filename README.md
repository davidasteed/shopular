Project Purpose:  
Build a dynamic web page showing 
1.  A form with basic AngularJS validation to allow a new item to be added to an inventory (an array of objects)
2.  an html table of existing items that can dynamically
 a) switch between US and UK currency
 b) sort columns based on the properties in that column
 c) change quanities or delete an item from the table
 d) display the new item added via the form above

This project uses our intro understanding of the Angular framework.  We'll create an Angular module, attach a controller with properties and values, and bootstrap index.html with the Angular framework.

Tech used:  
github
html5/css3/javascript es6
Angular 1.5.6
sass/scss 3.4.23

How to build this project:
create repository on github and check out
create src folder, and under src, create sass, js, and css folders
create empty files of the same name as in this repo
referring to the files in this repo, type in the code as shown, reviewing if the command/syntax/intent is unclear
validate if your local web server (such as http-server) will produce the expected result:  a form and an html table as explained above.
