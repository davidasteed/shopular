Project Purpose:  
Build a web page showing an html table of items that can switch between US and UK currency.  This project uses our intro understanding of the Angular framework.  We'll create an Angular module, attach a controller with properties and values, and bootstrap index.html with the Angular framework.

Tech used:  
github
html5/css3/javascript es6
Angular 1.5.6
sass/scss 3.4.23

How to build this project:
create repository on github and check out
create src folder, and under src, create sass, js, and css folders
create empty files of the same name as in this repo
referring to the files in this repo, type in the code as shown, reviewing if the command/syntax/intent is unclear
validate if your local web server (such as http-server) will produce the expected result:  an html table with a "US / UK" button that changes the values from dollars to Great British Pounds
